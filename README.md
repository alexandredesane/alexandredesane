Alexandre Desane  
Front-end developer & product maker  

I build small, focused web products.  
I care about clarity, speed and user experience.

I have been working on the web for more than 15 years, mostly on front-end.  
I design and build static websites, tools and local-first applications.

I prefer simple, durable stacks:

Vanilla JavaScript  
Alpine.js  
Sass (BEM)  
Vite  
Astro  
Grav CMS  

For native apps, I use:

Tauri  
Capacitor  

I avoid heavy frameworks and large abstractions.  
No React, no Vue, no Svelte, no Expo.  
I like software that stays small, understandable and fast.

I focus a lot on:

User experience  
Accessibility  
Mobile-first design  
SEO and web performance  
Long-term maintainability  

I enjoy building indie products that people actually use.  
Most of what I build is privacy-friendly and local-first by design.
