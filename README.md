Alexandre Desane  
Front-end developer & product maker  

I build small, focused web products.  
I care about clarity, speed and user experience.

I have been working on the web for more than 15 years, mostly on front-end.  
I design and build static websites, tools and local-first applications.

### Philosophy

I prefer simple, durable stacks.  
Less abstraction, more understanding.  
Software that stays small, readable and fast.

Privacy-friendly and local-first by default.

### Web stack

Vanilla JavaScript  
Alpine.js  
Sass (BEM)  
Vite  
Astro  
Grav CMS (instead of WordPress)

### App stack

Tauri

### What I care about

User experience  
Accessibility  
Mobile-first design  
SEO & performance  
Long-term maintainability

I enjoy building indie products that people actually use.
